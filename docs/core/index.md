# Core

The `@n8n-compose/core` package exposes the main functions of n8n-compose, such as `defineWorkflow` for building n8n-workflows from a configuration, and the `file` function to include the contents of a java- or typescript file into your workflow. For full documentation see the `@n8n-compose/core` specific readme.
